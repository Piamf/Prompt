    "In our quest to enhance the quality of life for citizens, we delve into the underlying causes of pressing issues, such as the chronic traffic congestion in Bangkok’s Metropolitan areas. By identifying these root causes and their associated pain points, we empower Members of Parliament (MPs) to communicate more effectively with their constituents, addressing their longstanding concerns with precision and empathy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach necessitates rigorous validation of proposed solutions. This involves scrutinising whether such measures align with guidelines and recommendations set forth by esteemed global organisations like the United Nations and the World Economic Forum. Such a methodical review ensures that our proposals are not only effective but also resonate with international best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, it is imperative to convey the significance of these proposals to the public in a manner that underscores their direct impact on daily life and future prospects. Drawing upon key insights from the Maslow Hierarchy of Needs and other relevant indicators, we aim to illustrate how these solutions are vital for enhancing the well-being and livelihoods of individuals and their families, thereby paving the way for a brighter future for subsequent generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of this endeavour hinges on public belief in the relevance and urgency of these issues and solutions. Once there is widespread recognition of their importance, we can anticipate substantial support for implementing these proposals in the Thai Parliament. This collective effort will not only solve immediate problems but also lay the groundwork for sustainable development and prosperity."

    "**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in the Prompt**:\n",
    "The prompt’s usage of RAG is critical for augmenting the knowledge of LLMs with additional, real-time, or private data, which is vital for creating AI applications that reason about contemporary or domain-specific data​​.\n",
    "In the prompt, RAG comprises indexing (ingesting and indexing data from sources) and the retrieval-generation chain (retrieving relevant data from the index and passing it to the model during runtime)​​. This process allows the prompt to provide contextually rich and updated answers by combining user queries with the latest retrieved information, ensuring that solutions for user groups, like Thailand residents, are informed by the most current and relevant data (Langchain (RAG), 2023)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiple Chains in the Prompt for Complex Query Processing**:\n",
    "The prompt leverages the concept of multiple chains from Langchain, allowing for more complex and nuanced processing of queries. This involves using different components or “chains” in a sequence or parallel configuration to handle various aspects of a query.\n",
    "For example, in finding solutions for specific user groups and benefits, the prompt might use one chain to retrieve current data relevant to the query, another to process this data in the context of existing knowledge, and yet another to generate insights or recommendations. This multi-chain approach allows the prompt to handle complex queries with greater depth and precision, offering more detailed and contextually relevant solutions (Langchain (Multiple), 2023).\n"

    "The prompt can be improved by incorporating the principles of Dynamic Capabilities Theory, which focuses on an organisation’s ability to adapt to changes in its environment by reconfiguring its resources and capabilities​​ (Marcello M. Mariani, 2022). To implement this, the prompt can integrate functionalities that allow it to dynamically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Search for and integrate data from various sources, especially those that reflect current market trends and public demands.\n",
    "- Regularly update its source URLs to include current and emerging topics in relevant fields.\n",
    "- Utilise APIs from frequently updated data sources like news sites, journals, and databases that provide insights into changing public demands.\n",
    "- Implement a feedback mechanism to continuously refine and update the search parameters based on the changing environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Combining Sources for Detailed Outputs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The current prompt primarily uses a single source for data retrieval. To improve this, the system can be designed to aggregate and synthesise information from multiple sources (Marcello M. Mariani, 2022). This can be achieved by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Expanding the WebBaseLoader to pull data from a variety of sources, as mentioned in your document​​.\n",
    "- Implement a keyword co-occurrence analysis, similar to the approach in your document, to identify relevant themes and topics across different sources​​.\n",
    "- Using advanced text analysis techniques to combine and synthesise information from these sources ensures a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n",

    "### Problems Identified:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specificity of User Group or Benefits:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the `user_group` or `for_benefit` parameters are too specific, they may not find relevant data in the chosen sources. To mitigate this issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Broaden the search parameters within the WebBaseLoader to include general keywords related to the specific user_group or for_benefit.\n",
    "- Implement a tiered search approach where the system first looks for specific information and, if not found, gradually broadens its search scope.\n",
    "- Include a fallback mechanism where the system can provide generalised suggestions or insights if specific data is unavailable.\n"
